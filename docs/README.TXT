  CosmoX Library                                  CosmoSoft Development Studios

  CosmoX is a game and graphics programming library written in 386 assembly
  language to get maximum speed (Although I am optimizing it for Pentium
  pipelining, so it will run faster on a Pentium).

  To see a more detailed description of the routines then look at COSMOX.DOC.
  
  If you use this library the only thing that I'm asking (at least by now) is
  that you give me credit and put my web site address wherever you see fit in
  your program. Also, it would be nice for me to see your work.

  If you have some ideas, bug report or any suggestion then drop e-mail.
  Don't forget it, don't hesitate to send e-mail. Although it can take some
  time before you get answer (I don't have Internet at home).

  - NOTE -
  SINCE COSMOX V1.1, SOME ROUTINES THAT TAKE STRINGS AS INPUT OR OUTPUT
  MANAGE THE QB STRING DESCRIPTORS (QB CONTROLS STRINGS WITH THEM) THEMSELVES,
  THIS CAN KEEP COSMOX FROM WORKING ON QB 7.1 (PDS) DUE TO DIFFERENT
  DESCRIPTOR FORMAT. (JUST A FEW ROUTINES)

  I hope you enjoy using it like I enjoyed coding it!!
